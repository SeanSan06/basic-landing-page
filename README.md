# Basic Landing Page
I created a simple landing page featuring short facts about each planet in our Solar System since I enjoy learning about space. I stuck to a simple design and added a few css tricks to add flair to my landing page.

## How its made
Technology used: HTML, CSS, and Github pages

HTML: I used HTML to add the basic content such as headers, links, images, and paragraphs.

CSS: I used CSS and flexbox to style my content into 5 sections; heading, hero, main, quote, and footer. Each section uses a different CSS styling trick that I learned.

Github pages: Used to host the landing page.

## What I learned
I learned how flexbox works and found a better understanding of how containers and items work with each other. I learned how to place images behind items which was espcially useful for styling my main content area. I also learned to make a glowing and glassy effect. Furthermore, I refined my understanding of basic CSS skills such as padding and margins.
